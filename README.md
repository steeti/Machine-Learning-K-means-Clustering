# Introduction

K-means is one of the most widely used unsupervised learning algorithms that solve well-known
clustering problems. The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set
through "k" clusters. 

The main idea is to define k centers, one for each cluster. These centers should be placed systematically since different
locations causes different results.
